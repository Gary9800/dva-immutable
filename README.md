# dva-immutable

Usage is consistent with [dva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva) without adding additional API, using [redux-immutable](https://github.com/gajus/redux-immutable) to support the immutable type.

`dva-immutable` uses Immutable.js API to iterate the `initialState`. you can defined `initialState` as JS type.

```javascript
import immutable from "dva-immutable/immutable"
```
